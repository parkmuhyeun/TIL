## Software programming vs. Software engineering
Software programming
- Single developer
- "Toy" applications
- Short lifespan
- Single or few stakeholders
    - Architect = Developer = Manager = Tester = Customer = User

Software engineering
- Teams of developers with multiple roles
- Complex Systems
- Indefinite lifespan
- Numerous stakeholders

## Economic and  management aspects of Software engineering
- Improved R.O.I (Return on Investment)
- Software production = Management + Development + Maintenance
- Maintenance costs 60% ~ 80% of all development costs
- Quicker development is not always preferable

## 4C in SE
What to manage in Software Engineering
- Complexity
- Change
- Cost
- Communication

Reliability(신뢰성): 소프트웨어 품질 목표중 주어진 시간 동안 주어진 기능을 오류없이 수행하는 정도
