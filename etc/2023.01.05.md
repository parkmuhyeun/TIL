IP: Internet Protocol

- Global delivery of packet through routers in networs
	- IP Addressing: globally unique address for each routable device
- IP routing
	- Network-wide process determining "good" end-to-end path

Network Layer
Layers
- 인접한 layer하고만 interact가능

Why Layering?
- Reduce complexity
- Improve flexibility

but
Sub-optimal performance
Cross-layer information often useful
Several "layer viloations"in practice

어떤 layer에서 header를 붙인다 -> encapsulate

Network Layer
Transport segment from sending to receiving host
on sending side encapsulates segments into datagrams
on receiving side, delivers segments to transport layer
network layer protocols in every host, router
router examines header fields in all ip datagrams passing through it

Two Key Network Layer Functions(Router가하는)
- Forwarding: move packets from router's input to appropriate router output
- Routing: determine route taken by packets from source to dest

Interplay Between Routing and Forwarding
forwarding table에서 range마다 link를 정해놓음(header안에 Ip destination address)

longest prefix matching
destinaton address 를 위해 forwarding table에서 찾아볼때 longest prefix 사용
* 겹치면 가장 구체적인 애 한테로보냄

Per-router Control Plane
router안에 
Individual routing algorithm components in each and every router interact in the control plane
forwarding은 data plane

software-defined networking 은 시험에 안나옴

IP datagram format(20byte, 160bit) 나머지 밑에 option
TTL 있는이유 - 무한 loop를 막기 위해
upper layer - 위 transparent layer에서 tcp, udp 중 선택

IP Addreess (IPv4)
- Unique 32bits numbers	(32비트중 앞 24비트 network(prefix) , 뒤 8비트 host
- Identifies a network interface
- Hierarchical Addressing
    - Network and host parts

- Always dotted-decimal notation
- Always network/host address split
- But nature of that split has changed over time

IP Address: Original Internet Addressing

![img](./img/NL_8.PNG) ( network 8bit, host 24bit)

Assumed 256 networks were more than enough

IP Addressing: Classful Addressing (1981)

![img](./img/NL_9.PNG) (host A(2^24-2), B(2^16-2), C(2^8-2).... 클래스)

Problem: networks only come in three sizes

IP Addressing: CIDR (1993)
CIDR: Classless Inter-Domain Routing	23비트까지 network part(prefix) 
- Subnet portion of address(prefix) of arbitrary length
- Address format: a.b.c.d/x, where x is # bits in subnet portion of address
- ex)200.23.16.0/23(subnetmask)

![img](./img/NL_10.PNG)

Classful vs Classless Addressing
- 애매한경우 Classful 같은 경우 많이 낭비되거나, 그렇다고 작은거를 부여하기에 부족함.
- Classless는 최대한 비슷하게 나눠줄 수 있음

 Subnets

- IP address:
    - Subnet part (prefix) - high order bits
    - Host part - low order bits
- What's a subnet?
    - Device interfaces with same subnet of IP address
    - Can physically reach each other without intervening router

 IP Fragmentation & Reassembly

- Network links have MTU(max.transfer size) - largest possible link-level frame
    - different link types, different MTUs
- Large IP datagram divided("fragmented") within net
    - One datagram becomes several datagrams
    - "Reassembled" only at final destination
    - IP header bits used to identify, order related fragments

헤더가 포함되어있어야함

- IP header(20byte) 때문에 길이가 1500이라도 실제 데이터는 1480이 담김
- 마지막 fragflag = 0
- ID	//같은 fragment인지
- offset = 실제offset/8 -> 순서맞춤

NAT: Network Address Translation

- Implemntation: NAT router must:
    - Outgoing datagrams: replace (Source IP address, port #) of every outgoing datagram to (NAT IP address, new port #) ... remote clients/servers will respond using (NAT IP address, new port #) as destination addr
    - Remember ( in NAT translation table) every (source IP address port #) to (NAT IP address, new port #) translation pair
    - Incoming datagrams: replace (NAT IP address, new port #) in des fields of every incoming datagram with corresponding (source IP address, port #) stored in NAT table
