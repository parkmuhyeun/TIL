Background
TCP/IP Protocol Model
A Closer Look at Network structure:
- Network edge
- Network core
- Access networks, physcial media
The Network Edge
- End systems
- client/server model
Internet Services Models
- Connection-oriented service
- Connectionless service
TCP
UDP
Network Core
- circuit swtiching
- packet switching
Circuit Switching
Packet Switching
Packet Switching VS. Circuit Switching
How Do Packet Delay and Loss Occur?
Packet delay: Four sources
1. Nodal rpocessing delay
2. Queueing delay
3. Transmission delay
4. propagation delay
IP: Internet Protocol
- IP routing

------------------------------

Network Layer Basic, IP Addressiing Fragmentation NAT
Layering
Why Layering?
Network Layer
Two Key Network Layer Functions
- Forwarding
- Routing
Interplay Between Routing and Forwarding
Longest Prefix Matching
Per-router Control Plane
Software-Defined Networking Control Plane
IP datagram format
IP Address (IPv4)
History of IP Addressing
IP Addressing: Original Internet Addressing (8 network, 24 host)
IP Addressing: Classful Addressing (1981)
IP Addressing: CIDR (1993)
Subnets
IP Fragmentation & Reassembly ( length, id, fragflag, offset)
IPv6
NAT: Network Address Translation

-------------------------------

DHCP

IP Addresses: How To Get One?
- DHCP
DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
DHCP overview:
- host broadcasts DHCP discover msg [optional]
- DHCP server responds with DHCP offer msg [optional]
- host requests IP address: DHCP request msg
- DHCP server sends address: DHCP ack msg 
DHCP: More Than IP Addresses
- address of first-hop router for client
- name and IP address of DNS sever
- network mask (indicating network versus host portion of address)
how does network get subnet part of IP address?
: gets allocated portion of its provider ISP’s address space

--------------------------------------

ICMP, Tunneling, and Routing algorithms - 1

ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol
- Used by hosts and routers to communicate network-level information
	- error reporting: unreachable host, network, port, protocol
	- echo request/reply (used by ping)
Traceroute & ICMP
Transition From IPv4 to IPv6
Tunneling

------

Routing Protocols
- path
- good
Routing Algorithms
- Link-state algorithm (Dijkstra's algorithm)
- Distance-vector algorithm (Bellman-ford equation)
Dijkstras Algorithm
Dijkstra’s algorithm: oscillations possible

------------------------------------------------------

 Routing Algorithms (2)-

Distance-vcetor algorithm (Dv)
- Bellman-Ford equation
Dx(y) = C(x,y) + D(y, y)
          C(x,z) + D(z, y)
           알던거     전해받은것
Each local iteration caused by: 
- Local link cost change 
- DV update message from neighbor
Distance vector: link cost changes
	- posion reverse(해당 경유지의 당사자한테는 무한대를 보냄)

-------------------------------------------------------

6장 Hierarchical Routing
Routing Algorithms We Learned
- Link-state algorithm
	- Based on dijkstra’s algorithm 
	- OSPF 
		- Open Shortest Path First
- Distance-vector algorithm 
	- Based on bellman-ford equation
	- RIP
	- Routing Information Protocol
Making Routing Scalable
Hierarchical Routing: Internet Approach to Scalable Routing
- Intra-AS (같은 하나의 as안에 네트워크),
- Inter-AS (여러개의 as들의 네트워크)
Autonomous System 
Interconnected ASes
Relationship Between Networks
- Running an an ISP
	• Human resource
	• Physical connectivity and bandwidth
	• Hardware
	• Space and power
	• Other things
전에는 가장빠른걸로 햇는데 결국에는 이제(as) 값싼걸로 함

BGP-4 (Border Gateway Protocol)
- policy based routing(가까운곳있어도 경쟁업체라 돌아서 보냄)
