Transport Layer Basic

Transport Services And Protocols
- Provide logical communication between app processes running on different hosts
- Transport protocols run in end systems
	- send side: breaks app messages into segments, passes  to network layer
	- rcv side: reassembles segments into messages, passes to app layer
- More than one transport protocol available to apps
	- Internet: TCP and UDP

Internet Transport-layer Protocols
- Reliable, in-order delivery (TCp)
	- Congestion control
	- Flow control
	- Connection setup
- Unreliable, unordered delivery: UDP
- Services not available:
	- delay guarantees
	-  bandwidth guarantees

Transport vs Network layer
- Network layer
	- Logical communication between hosts
- Transport layer
	- Logcial communication between processes

Addressing Processes
- To receive messages, process must have identifier
- Host device has unique 32-bit Ip address
- Identifier includes both IP address and port numbers

Sockets
- Process sends/receives messages to/from its socket
(applications controlled by app developer)
(transport, network, link controlled by Os)

Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
- multiplexing at sender: handle data from multiple sockets, add transport header
- demultiplexing at receiver: use header info to deliver received segments to correct socket

How Demultiplexing Works
- Host receives IP datagrams
	- Each datagram has source IP address, destination IP address
	- Each datagram carries one transport-layer segment
	- Each segment has source, destinatoin port number
- Host uses IP address & port numbers to direct segment to appropriate socket

Connectionless Demultiplexing
- When host receives UDP segment:
	- checks destination port # in segment
	- directs UDP segment to socket with that port #

-> IP datagrams with same dest.port #, but different source IP addresses and/or source port numbers will be directed to same socket at destination

Connection-oriented demux
- TCP socket is identified by 4-tuple:
	- Source IP address
	- Source port number
	- Dest IP address
	- Dest port number
- Demux: receiver uses all four values to direct segment to appropriate socket
- Server host may support many simultaneous TCP sockets:
	- each socket identified by its own 4-tuple
- Web servers have different sockets for each connecting client

UDP: User Datagram Protocol
- No frills, bare bones
- best effort(일단 최선을 다해볼게 물론 lost나도 모름)
- lost
- delivered out-of-order-to app
- connectionlesss(no handshaking)
- usage
	- streaming multimedia apps
	- dns
	- snmp
- reliable transfer over UDP
	- Add reliability at application layer
	- application-specific error recvoery

UDP segment header
32bit
sourceport# | dest port#
 length       | checksum
applicatoin data(paylaod)

why is there a udp?
- no connection establishment(which can add delay)
- simple
- small header size
- no congestion control (UDP can blast away as fast as desired)

UDP checksum
goal: detect error
sender:
- treat segment contents as sequence of 16-bit integers
- checksum: addition(1's complement sum) of segment contents
- sender puts checksum value into UDP checksum field
receiver
- compute checksum of received segment
- check if computed checksum equals checksum field value:
	- No: error detected(다를 경우)
	- Yes: no error detected but maybe errors nonetheless? (같을 경우)

ex)
1. adding numbers
2. carryout from the most signifacnt it needs to be added to the result
3. reverse all numbers
```

Reliable Data Transfer Protocol

what can happen over unreliable channel?
- message (packet) error
- message (packet) loss

rdt1.0 Reliable Transfer over Reliable Channel
- Underlying channel perfectly reliable
	- No bit errors
	- No loss of packets
- Sender sends data into underlying channel
- Receiver reads data into underlying channel

rdt2.0: Channel with Bit Errors(no loss)
- What mechanism do we need to deal with error?
	- error detection
		- Add checksum field
	- Receiver Feedback
		- Acknowledgements(ACKs): receiver explicitly tells sender that pkt received OK
		- Negatvie acknoledgement(NAKs): recevier explicitly tells sender that pkt had errors
	- Retransmission
		- sender retransmits packet on receipt of NAK

-> Stop-and-wait protocol: Sender sends one packet, then waits for receiver response

what happenes if ack or nak has errors?
- sender simply resends the current packet
- handling duplicate packets: receiver discard duplicate packet
그러나 같은걸 두번 보내고 싶어 할지도 모름
-> rdt2.1

rdt 2.1: Introducing Sequence Number
- Sender adds sequnce number to each packet
- Sender retransmits current packet with same sequence number when received garbled ACK/NAK
- Receiver discards duplicate packet

rdt 2.2: NAK-free Version
- Same functionality as rdt2.1 only with ACks (no NAK)
- Instead of NAK, receiver sends ACK for last correctly received packet
- Receiver must explicitly include seq # of packet being ACKed
- Duplicated ACk at sendder results in same action as NAK
	- retransmits current packet

rdt 3.0: Lossy Channel with Bit Error
- Net assumption
	- Underlying channel can also lose packets (data/ACK)
- Checksum, seq. #, ACks,, retransmissions will be of help ..
	- but not enough
- What mechanisms do we need for packet loss? Timer (timeout -> packet loss)
- Sender waits "reasonable" amount of time for ACK (a Time-out)
timer를 너무 빠르게? loss 되지않고 잘오고있는데도 resend 계속해야함 (overhead)
timer를 너무 느리게? 데이터 전송이 느릴거임(이미 손실됬는데도 나중에 알아채게됨)
timer를 적당하게 해야함
```
