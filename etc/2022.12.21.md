A parallel projections

- A parallel projection preserves "relative proportions" of objects, and this is the method used in drafting to produce scale drawings of 3D objects
- Accurate views of the various sides of an object are obtained with a parallel projection, but this does not give us a realistic representation of the appearance of a 3D object

- Orthographic Projection(직각 투영)
  - The projection plane is perpendicular to a principal axis
 투영방향 직각, 투영하는 면이 투영선하고 직각(주축하고 직각)
front view, side view, top view 3개의 투영면이 각각의 주축과 직각의 방향

+ Axonometric Orthographic Projection
 - 투영면이 주축하고 직각이지 않다 but 투영방향은 직각
	Axonomteric views
	Dimetric
	투영면이 3개의 주축중에서 2개의 주축하고 이루는 각도가 비슷
	Trimetric
	투영면이 3개의 주축하고 모두 비슷
	Isometric Projection (Trimetric에서)
	투영면하고 3개의주축하고 이루는 각도가 같은 각도로

- Oblique projection(경사 투영)
	- Projection plane normal and the direction of projection differ
	- Combine properties of the front, top, and side orthographic projections with those of the axonomtetric projections

Representation of curves and surfaces

Smooth Curves and Surfaces
- Many real-world objects are inherently smooth, and much of computer graphics involves modeling real world
- CAD, high-quality character typefaces, data plots, and artists' sketches all contain smooth curves and surfaces
- The path of a camera or object in an animation sequence is almost always smooth
- similarly, a path through intensity or color space of often must be smooth
- Most common representation for surfaces:
  - Polygon mesh
  - Parametric surfaces
  - Quadric surfaces
- Solid modeling

wireframe modeling 점과선으로만 표현
surface modeling 표면을가지고 표현(곡면기반모델)
solid modeling 점과선 면뿐아니라, 물리적인속성(질량)까지 추가해서 표현

Polygon Mesh Surfaces (일반평면으로 모델링)
- Well suited for representing flat-faced objectes
- Seldom satisfactory for curved-facd objects
- Space inefficient
- Simpler algorithms
- Hardware support

Parametric Surfaces (파라메트릭방법으로 모델링)
Parametric Polynomial Curves and Surfaces
- Permit multiple values for a single x or y
- Represent infinite slopes
- Easier to manipulate interactively
- Can either interpolate or approximate
- Space efficient
- More complex algorithms
- Little hardware suport

Viewing in 3D
- The 3D viewing is inherently more complex than is the 2D viewing process
- In 2D, we simply specify a window on the 2D world and a viewport on the 2D view surface
- The complexity of 3D viewing is caused in part by the added dimension and in part by the fact that display devices are only 2D

Classical Views
Front elevation (바라보는방향 물체 바로앞)
Elevation oblique (물체 경사지게)
Plan oblique(물체를 위에서 바라봤을때, 경사지게)
Isometric(등각)
One-point perspective (원근투영)
Three-point perspective (원근 투영)

Creation of Our 'Photo'
1. Specification of Projection Type
- Resolve mismatch between 3D objects and 2D displays by introducing projcetions, which transform 3D objects onto a 2D projection plane
- Perspective and parallel orthographic
2. Specification of Viewing Parameters
- 3차원 실세계데이터를 2차원으로 하기위해서 발생되는 조건(관측자의 눈, 보여지는 면)들을 결정해야됨
- We use two coordinate systems - that of the "scene"(장면좌표계) and another that we call the "viewing or eye coordinate system"(viewing 좌표계)
- 다양한 조건들로 인해 다양하게 나옴
3. Clipping in three Dimension
4. Projection and DIsplay
- The contents of the projection of the view volume onto the projection plane, called the window, are transformed into the viewport for display

Conceptual Model of the 3D Viewing Process
3D world-coordinate output primitives -> Clip against view volume ---Clipped world coordinates--> Project onto projection plane -> Transform into viewport in 2D device coordinates for display -> 2D device coordinates

Projections
- Perspective Projections
  - Projections은 n차원에서 그보다 더적은 차원으로 변환하는것
  - 여기선 3차원에서 2차원으로
  - The projection of a 3D object is defined by straight projection rays, called projectors, emanating from a center of projection(COP), passing through each point of the object, and intersecting a projection plane to form the projection
-> Perspective projection (투영선이 한점으로 모여서 중심점이생김), Parallel projection (투영선이 평행)
Perspective projection 유한거리내, Parallel projection 무한거리

planar vs nonplanar geometric projection
투영면이 평면 vs 곡면
투영선은 직선 vs 곡선

Perspective Projections 원근투영, 가깝고 먼것을 구분되게 표현 (몇가지점으로 표현할지로 나눔)
- A perspective projection produces "realistic views" but does not preserve relative proportions
  - exact shape and measurement 얻을 수 없음
  - 길이같은거 계산x
  - Angles are preserved on only those faces of the object parallel to the projection plane
  - parallel lines do not in general project as parallel line
  - 실제물체보다 투영물체 길이가 더 작음(가까이있기떄문에)
  - 투영되는 평행선이 하나의 점으로 수렴하는점 -> vanishing point(소실점) (실제물체는 평행한데 투영되는곳에서는 소실점으로 수렴됨)
  - 투영면과 평행하지않은것은 소실점으로 감으로인해서 평행하지않게된다.
  - 소실점을 몇가지로두느냐 어디로두느냐에 따라 다양하게 나옴
  - 소실점을 위치를 주축상에설정하면 principal(axis) vanishing point
(a) Three-point(소실점 3개)
(b) Two-point(소실점 2개)
(c) One-point(소실점 1개)

Polygon Meshes
- A polygon mesh is a colletion of edges, vertices (each edge is shared by at most two polygons)
- edge connects two vertices and a polygon is a closed sequence of edges
- edge can be shared by two adjacent polygons, a vertex is shared by at least two edges, and every edges is part of some polygon

Representing Polygon Meshes
- Three Polygon-mesh representations:
  - Explicit representaiton
  - pointers to a vertex list
  - pointers to an edge list

Explicit representation
- Each polygon is represented by a list of vertext coordinates
	- P = ((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2), ... , (xn, yn, zn)).
- vertices are stored in the order
- There are edges between successive vertices

Explicit Representation - advantages
- For a single polygon, this representation is space- efficient

Explicit Representation - disadvantages
- For a polygon mesh, much space is lost, because the coordinate of shared vertices are duplicated
- There is no explicit representatiohn of shared edges and vertices
- to drag a vertex and all its incident edges interactively, we must find all polygons that share the vertex
- This search requires comparing the coordinate triples of one polygon with those of all other polygons

Pointers to a Vertex List
- Polygons have each vertex in the polygon mesh stord just once, in the vertex list
- A polygon is defined by a list of indices into the vertex list

Pointers to a vertex List - Pros & Cons
- Since each vertex is stored just once, considerable space is saved
- changed easily
- difficult to find polygons that share an edge, and shared polygon edges are still drawn twice when all polygon outlines are displayed 

Pointers to an Edge List
not to the vertex list, but rather to an edge list
