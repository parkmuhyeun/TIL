Illmuniation Modles - Light Sources

Surface Rendering
- realistic displays of a scene are obtained by generating perspective projections of objects and by applying natural lighting effects to the visible surfaces
- Phtorealism in computer graphics involves two elements:
	- accurate representations of objects
	- good physical descriptions of the lighting effects in a scene
		- lighting effects include light reflections, tranparency, surface texture and shadows

Light Sources
- When we view an opaque nonluminous object, we see reflected light from the surfaces of the object
- The total reflected light is the sum of the contributions from light sources and other reflecting surfaces in the scene

Point Source(점 광원) & Distributed Light Source (확산 광원)
상대적인 크기에 따라서 나뉘어짐
- Point source model is a reasonable approximation for sources whose dimensions are small compared to the size of objects in the scene (밝기가 위치에 따라 달라짐)
- In distributed light source model, the illumination effects cannot be approximated realistically, because the area of the source is not small compared to the surfaces in the scene

Ambient Light(주변광)
- The uniform lighting is called ambient light
- Ambient light has no spatial or directional characteristics
- The amount of ambient light incident on each object is a constnat for all surfaces and over all directions (밝기가 모두 동일)
- But the intensity of the reflected light for each surface depends on the optical properties(such as glossy(광택), matte(비광택), opaque(불투명), and transparen(투명) ) of the surfaces

Illumination equation for ambient light
l = k(a)l(a) 0 <= k(a) <=1
k(a) = ambient-reflection coefficient(or material property) 물체의 재질, 광학적인 특성에 따라
l(a)= the intensity of the ambient light, assumed to be constant for all objects
주변광은 확산광원을 전제로 한식

Illumination Models - Diffuse Relfection

Diffuse Reflection(확산 반사)
- Sufrcaes that are rough(거친), or grainy(작은 알갱이), tend to scatter the reflected light in all directions
- this scattered light is called diffuse reflections
- A vary rough matte surface produces primarily diffuse reflections, so that the surfaces equally bright from all viewing directions
- For a given surface, the brightness depends only on the angle 0 between the direction to the light source and the surface normal
- the amount of light energy that falls on dA is proportional to cos0
기울어지면 그만큼 빛을받는면적이 넓어짐 (dA/cos0)

Diffuse Reflection with Point Light Source
l = k(d)l(p) cos0 =  k(d)l(p) (N*L)	(N * L = |N||L|cos0)
k(d) : diffuse-reflection coefficient(0 <= k(d) <= 1)
l(p) : the point light source's intensity
광원인경우 점광원을전제로 주변광은 확산광원을 전제로 한식

Total Diffuse Reflection
l = k(a)l(a) + k(d)l(p) (N*L)        주변광식 + 확산반사 식

Light Source Attenuation ( 겹쳤을때 구분이 안되기떄문에 거리에따라 att반영)
l = k(a)l(a) + f(att)k(d)l(p) (N*L)
f(att) = 1/d(L)^2	(거리)
- In practice, however, this often does not work well
	- 거리가 매우 멀리있다면(d(L)이 크면), 그 주변값에 대해서 의미있게 변하지않음
	- 거리가 매우 가깝다면(d(L)이 작으면), f(att)가 값이 커서 너무 민감하게 변함
=>  f(att) = min( 1/ c1 + c2d1 + c3d(L)^2, 1)	아무리 커도 1의크기를넘지않음
	- c1, c2, and c3, are user-defined constants associated with the light source
	c1 상수항 c2 거리 c3 (1/d(L))

Diffuse Reflection - Colored Lights & surfaces
- Colored lights and surfaces are commonly treated by writing separate equations for each component of the color model
- We represent an object's diffuse color by one variable of O(d) for each component
	- I(R)= k(a)l(aR)O(dR) + f(att)k(d)
	- I(G)= k(a)l(aG)O(dG) + f(att)k(d)l(pG)O(dG) (N*L)
	- I(G)= k(a)l(aB)O(dB) + f(att)k(d)l(pB)O(dB) (N*L)

Illumination Models - Specular Reflection (정반사, 거울반사)
- When we look at an illuminated shiny surface, such as polished metal, an apple, or a person's forehead, we see a highlight or bright spot, at certain viewing directions
- this phenomenon, called specular reflection, is the result of total, or near total, reflection of incident light in a concentrated region-around the specular-reflection angle
- Whereas the light reflected from the rest of the area is the result of diffuse reflection

Specular Reflection
- On a perfectly shiny surface, such as a perfect mirror, light is relfected only in the direction of relection R, which is L mirrored about N
- Thus the viewer can see speculary reflected light from a mirror only when the angle a is zero
a가 적으면 적을수록 정반사되는점이강해짐(최대 R, V 겹칠때, a is zero)
- The Phong uillumination model
	- a가 0일때 가장 강해짐(빛의세기 더 세짐, 점도 더작아짐)
	- 함수중에 cos a가 비슷함
	- cos^na에서 n이 클수록 더 가팔라지게 떨어짐
shiny surface (large n)
dull sufrace(small n)
	- the amount of incident light specularly reflected depens on the angle of incidence 0
	- 주변광식 + f(att)l(p) [ 확산반사식 + W(0)cos^na]
	= 주변광식 + f(att)l(p) [ 확산반사식 + k(s) (R * V)^n ]

Shading Models for polygons

Constant Shading
- The simplest shading model for a polygon is constant shading, also known as faceted shading or flat shading
- This approach is valid if several assumptions
	- 광원이 엄청 멀리 있을경우
	- 관측자가 아주 멀리 있는경우
	- polygon이 평평한경우

Interpolated Shading(constant shading보강)
- Shading information is linearly interpolated across a trinagle from values determined for its vertices

Polygon-Mesh Shading
- 개별은 다르지만 인접해서 겹치는구간에서 문제가 생김(facted appearance)
- 기본적인 방법은 더 촘촘하게한다. 그러나 한계
- 줄이기위한 방법 -> Mach and effect
- smooth surface
	- Gouraud shading, Phong shading

Mach band effect
어두운것은 더 어둡게 밝은것은 더 밝게(constrast 대비효과) ->경계부분 더 뚜렷

Gouraud Shading
- intensity interpolation shading or color interpolation shading, eliminates intensity discontinuities
- does not cmpletely eliminate such intensity changes
꼭짓점에서만 법선벡터계산
Phong Shading
- phong shading, also knwon as normal-vector interpolation shading, interpolates the surface normal vector, rather than the intensity
모든지점에서 법선벡터계산

Texture Mapping
- 더 finer 하고 more intricate해지면 polygon과 other geomteric privmitives become less practical
- An alternative is to map an image, either digitized or synthesized on tto a surface (texture mapping or pattern mapping) the image is called a texture map

texture mapping increases scene detail without increasing geometeric complexity

Bump Mapping
- Surfaces angled upwards ten to be brightly lit, and downwared inclined surfaces tend to be darker
- Therefore it follows that if your eyes see light and dark areas on an object, they will interpret them as bumps ; 
lighter bits it takes as up-facing, and darker bits it takes as down-facing

Environment Mapping
물체표면에 다른물체들 비치는경우
