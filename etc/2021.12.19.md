Decision-support systems
Decision-support systems are used to make business decisions, often based on data collected by on-line transaction-processing systems.

- Data analysis tasks are simplified by specialized tools and SQL extensions
- Statistical analysis packages (e.g., : S++) can be interfaced with databases
- Data mining seeks to discover knowledge automatically in the form of statistical rules and patterns from large databases.
- A data warehouse archives information gathered from multiple sources, and stores it under a unified schema, at a single site.

Data Analysis and OLAP

- Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)
	- Interactive analysis of data, allowing data to be summarized and viewed in different ways in an online fashion (with negligible delay)
- Data that can be modeled as dimension attributes and measure attributes are called multidimensional data
- pivoting: changing the dimensions
- slicing: creating a cross-tab for fixed values only
- Rollup: 차원줄여나가는거
- Drill down: 차원 늘려나가는거

OLAP Implementation

Extended Aggregation in SQL
- The cube operation computes union of group by’s on every subset of the specified attributes
- all
- rollup

Ranking

Data Warehousing

Design Issues
- When and how to gather data

Warehouse Schemas
- star schema
- Snoeflake schema
- Constellation

Data Mining
- Prediction 
- Classification
- Regression
- Associations
- Clusters

Association Rules
- Support(지지도)
- Confidence(신뢰도)

Finding Support
- a priori

Clustering
Collaborative Filtering
Text mining
Data visualization

Big data


Querying Big Data
- Transaction processing systesm that need very high scalability
- need to support non-relation data

Big Data Storage Systems
- provides single file-system view
- Highly scalable distributed file system
- provides redundant storage

Hadoop
- Applications are written in a high-level programming language
- No network programming or temporal dependency
- Nodes should communicate as little as possible
- A "shared nothing" architecture
- Perform computation where the data is already stored as often as possible

Hadoop Distributed File System
- NameNode
- DataNode
- Data Coherency
	- Write-once-read-many acces model
	- client can only append to existing files

MapReduce
- programming model for expressing distributed computations on massive amounts of data
- execution framework
what o, how x

WordCount

Map Reduce vs Databases

spark  
- RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets)
- partition
