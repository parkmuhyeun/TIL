Representation of curves and surfaces

Smooth Curves and Surfaces
- Many real-world objects are inherently smooth, and much of computer graphics involves modeling real world
- CAD, high-quality character typefaces, data plots, and artists' sketches all contain smooth curves and surfaces
- The path of a camera or object in an animation sequence is almost always smooth
- similarly, a path through intensity or color space of often must be smooth
- Most common representation for surfaces:
  - Polygon mesh
  - Parametric surfaces
  - Quadric surfaces
- Solid modeling

wireframe modeling 점과선으로만 표현
surface modeling 표면을가지고 표현(곡면기반모델)
solid modeling 점과선 면뿐아니라, 물리적인속성(질량)까지 추가해서 표현

Polygon Mesh Surfaces (일반평면으로 모델링)
- Well suited for representing flat-faced objectes
- Seldom satisfactory for curved-facd objects
- Space inefficient
- Simpler algorithms
- Hardware support

Parametric Surfaces (파라메트릭방법으로 모델링)
Parametric Polynomial Curves and Surfaces
- Permit multiple values for a single x or y
- Represent infinite slopes
- Easier to manipulate interactively
- Can either interpolate or approximate
- Space efficient
- More complex algorithms
- Little hardware suport

Polygon Meshes
- A polygon mesh is a colletion of edges, vertices (each edge is shared by at most two polygons)
- edge connects two vertices and a polygon is a closed sequence of edges
- edge can be shared by two adjacent polygons, a vertex is shared by at least two edges, and every edges is part of some polygon

Representing Polygon Meshes
- Three Polygon-mesh representations:
  - Explicit representaiton
  - pointers to a vertex list
  - pointers to an edge list

Explicit representation
- Each polygon is represented by a list of vertext coordinates
	- P = ((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2), ... , (xn, yn, zn)).
- vertices are stored in the order
- There are edges between successive vertices

Explicit Representation - advantages
- For a single polygon, this representation is space- efficient

Explicit Representation - disadvantages
- For a polygon mesh, much space is lost, because the coordinate of shared vertices are duplicated
- There is no explicit representatiohn of shared edges and vertices
- to drag a vertex and all its incident edges interactively, we must find all polygons that share the vertex
- This search requires comparing the coordinate triples of one polygon with those of all other polygons

Pointers to a Vertex List
- Polygons have each vertex in the polygon mesh stord just once, in the vertex list
- A polygon is defined by a list of indices into the vertex list

Pointers to a vertex List - Pros & Cons
- Since each vertex is stored just once, considerable space is saved
- changed easily
- difficult to find polygons that share an edge, and shared polygon edges are still drawn twice when all polygon outlines are displayed 

Pointers to an Edge List
not to the vertex list, but rather to an edge list
