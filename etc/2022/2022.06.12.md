Illumination Models - Specular Reflection (정반사, 거울반사)
- When we look at an illuminated shiny surface, such as polished metal, an apple, or a person's forehead, we see a highlight or bright spot, at certain viewing directions
- this phenomenon, called specular reflection, is the result of total, or near total, reflection of incident light in a concentrated region-around the specular-reflection angle
- Whereas the light reflected from the rest of the area is the result of diffuse reflection

Specular Reflection
- On a perfectly shiny surface, such as a perfect mirror, light is relfected only in the direction of relection R, which is L mirrored about N
- Thus the viewer can see speculary reflected light from a mirror only when the angle a is zero
a가 적으면 적을수록 정반사되는점이강해짐(최대 R, V 겹칠때, a is zero)
- The Phong uillumination model
	- a가 0일때 가장 강해짐(빛의세기 더 세짐, 점도 더작아짐)
	- 함수중에 cos a가 비슷함
	- cos^na에서 n이 클수록 더 가팔라지게 떨어짐
shiny surface (large n)
dull sufrace(small n)
	- the amount of incident light specularly reflected depens on the angle of incidence 0
	- 주변광식 + f(att)l(p) [ 확산반사식 + W(0)cos^na( k(s) (R * V)^n )]


Shading Models for polygons
- The simplest shading model for a polygon is constant shading, also known as faceted shading or flat shading
- This approach is valid if several assumptions
	- 광원이 엄청 멀리 있을경우
	- 관측자가 아주 멀리 있는경우
	- polygon이 평평한경우

Interpolated Shading(constant shading보강)
- Shading information is linearly interpolated across a trinagle from values determined for its vertices

Polygon-Mesh Shading
- 개별은 다르지만 인접해서 겹치는구간에서 문제가 생김(facted appearance)
- 기본적인 방법은 더 촘촘하게한다. 그러나 한계
- 줄이기위한 방법 -> Mach and effect
- smooth surface
	- Gouraud shading, Phong shading

Mach band effect
어두운것은 더 어둡게 밝은것은 더 밝게(constrast 대비효과) ->경계부분 더 뚜렷

Gouraud Shading
- intensity interpolation shading or color interpolation shading, eliminates intensity discontinuities
- does not cmpletely eliminate such intensity changes
꼭짓점에서만 법선벡터계산
Phong Shading
- phong shading, also knwon as normal-vector interpolation shading, interpolates the surface normal vector, rather than the intensity
모든지점에서 법선벡터계산

Texture Mapping
- 더 finer 하고 more intricate해지면 polygon과 other geomteric privmitives become less practical
- An alternative is to map an image, either digitized or synthesized on tto a surface (texture mapping or pattern mapping) the image is called a texture map

texture mapping increases scene detail without increasing geometeric complexity

Bump Mapping
- Surfaces angled upwards ten to be brightly lit, and downwared inclined surfaces tend to be darker
- Therefore it follows that if your eyes see light and dark areas on an object, they will interpret them as bumps ; 
lighter bits it takes as up-facing, and darker bits it takes as down-facing

Environment Mapping
물체표면에 다른물체들 비치는경우
