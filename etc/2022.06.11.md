Illmuniation and Shading


Illmuniation Modles - Light Sources

Surface Rendering
- realistic displays of a scene are obtained by generating perspective projections of objects and by applying natural lighting effects to the visible surfaces
- Phtorealism in computer graphics involves two elements:
	- accurate representations of objects
	- good physical descriptions of the lighting effects in a scene
		- lighting effects include light reflections, tranparency, surface texture and shadows

Light Sources
- When we view an opaque nonluminous object, we see reflected light from the surfaces of the object
- The total reflected light is the sum of the contributions from light sources and other reflecting surfaces in the scene

Point Source(점 광원) & Distributed Light Source (확산 광원)
상대적인 크기에 따라서 나뉘어짐
- Point source model is a reasonable approximation for sources whose dimensions are small compared to the size of objects in the scene (밝기가 위치에 따라 달라짐)
- In distributed light source model, the illumination effects cannot be approximated realistically, because the area of the source is not small compared to the surfaces in the scene

Ambient Light(주변광)
- The uniform lighting is called ambient light
- Ambient light has no spatial or directional characteristics
- The amount of ambient light incident on each object is a constnat for all surfaces and over all directions (밝기가 모두 동일)
- But the intensity of the reflected light for each surface depends on the optical properties(such as glossy(광택), matte(비광택), opaque(불투명), and transparen(투명) ) of the surfaces

Illumination equation for ambient light
l = k(a)l(a) 0 <= k(a) <=1
k(a) = ambient-reflection coefficient(or material property)
l(a)= the intensity of the ambient light, assumed to be constant for all objects

Illumination Models - Diffuse Relfection

Diffuse Reflection(확산 반사)
- Sufrcaes that are rough(거친), or grainy(작은 알갱이), tend to scatter the reflected light in all directions
- this scattered light is called diffuse reflections
- A vary rough matte surface produces primarily diffuse reflections, so that the surfaces equally bright from all viewing directions
- For a given surface, the brightness depends only on the angle 0 between the direction to the light source and the surface normal
- the amount of light energy that falls on dA is proportional to cos0
기울어지면 그만큼 빛을받는면적이 넓어짐 (dA/cos0)

Diffuse Reflection with Point Light Source
l = k(d)l(p) cos0 =  k(d)l(p) (N*L)	(N * L = |N||L|cos0)
k(d) : diffuse-reflection coefficient(0 <= k(d) <= 1)
l(p) : the point light source's intensity
광원인경우 점광원을전제로 주변광은 확산광원을 전제로 한식

Total Diffuse Reflection
l = k(a)l(a) + k(d)l(p) (N*L)        주변광식 + 확산반사 식

Light Source Attenuation ( 겹쳤을때 구분이 안되기떄문에 거리에따라 att반영)
l = k(a)l(a) + f(att)k(d)l(p) (N*L)
f(att) = 1/d(L)^2	(거리)
- In practice, however, this often does not work well
	- 거리가 매우 멀리있다면(d(L)이 크면), 그 주변값에 대해서 의미있게 변하지않음
	- 거리가 매우 가깝다면(d(L)이 작으면), f(att)가 값이 커서 너무 민감하게 변함
=>  f(att) = min( 1/ c1 + c2d1 + c3d(L)^2, 1)	아무리 커도 1의크기를넘지않음
	- c1, c2, and c3, are user-defined constants associated with the light source
	c1 상수항 c2 거리 c3 (1/d(L))

Diffuse Reflection - Colored Lights & surfaces
- Colored lights and surfaces are commonly treated by writing separate equations for each component of the color model
- We represent an object's diffuse color by one variable of O(d) for each component
	- I(R)= k(a)l(aR)O(dR) + f(att)k(d)
	- I(G)= k(a)l(aG)O(dG) + f(att)k(d)l(pG)O(dG) (N*L)
	- I(G)= k(a)l(aB)O(dB) + f(att)k(d)l(pB)O(dB) (N*L)
